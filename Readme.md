#iot-dslinks
The iot-dslinks repository contains the code for DS Links implemented by IBM IoT Client Library team to be used with IBM Edge Analytics Agent. 
Refer [Edge Analytics recipe](https://developer.ibm.com/recipes/tutorials/getting-started-with-edge-analytics-in-watson-iot-platform/) to get to know about how to install and configure IBM Edge Analytics Agent on Raspberry Pi 3.

###DS Links in Java
We have DS Links written using Java placed under the directory [Java](https://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/iot-dslinks/tree/master/java). We have DS Link for Raspberry Pi 3 to provide system 
information and DS Link to get device data from attached Arduino Uno written using Java.
